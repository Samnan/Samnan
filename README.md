ðŸ‘‹ Hello World.

âœ¨ I am a senior fullstack developer, devop and tinkerer.

âœ¨ Author of [MyWebSQL](https://github.com/Samnan/MyWebSQL), a database management tool for every day use for developers.

âœ¨ I like to experiment with new software technologies and use some of them in my projects, specially those that don't get in my way.

âœ¨ Most recent projects created with Laravel, React, Framework7, React Native, Cordova/Capacitor etc.

âœ¨ Side projects include playing around with bash scripts, batch files, emulation and similar cool stuff.
